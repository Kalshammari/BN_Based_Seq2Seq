# Forecasting Multivariate Time Series of Magnetic Field Parameters of Solar Events: A Sequence to Sequence Learning Approach

The code is an implemintation of a deep sequence to sequence learning approach of multivariate time series forecasting of magnetic field parameters of solar events. It is impleminted using Keras and PyTorch.


**Overview**

This repository provides the implementation of deep sequence to sequence learning model based on batch normalization and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that implements
multivariate time series forecasting for solar magnetic field parameters. The repository has:

    data/ contains the required dataset files.
    Models/ contains the implementation of the deep sequence to sequence learning model based on batch normalization and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network  and baseline metods implementation.
    requirements.txt contains the libraries and tools needed to execute the models.
    
  **Dependencies**
  
The models has been tested running under Python 3.9.7, with the required packages installed (see the requirements.txt for package details along with their dependencies). In addition, CUDA 11.1 in a Windows server has been used.
